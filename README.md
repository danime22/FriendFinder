# Friend Finder

Friend finder is a simple dating app developed for the Fast 2018 Cohort of the SMU coding bootcamp. This application demonstrates how to build a simple dating type application with an HTML friend end and a Node backend. The application asks the user to rate themselves on 10 questions, it then matches them with the "user" that answered the closest to their answers. The application is seeded with 10 anime characters initially, but adds each user to the list of available profiles as they complete the form.


A running version of this application can be found [here](https://friend-finder-yd.herokuapp.com/).
